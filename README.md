# CalcWars

## Introduction

CalWars is a game that tries to balance having mindless fun with logical thinking as well. Some levels with either require mindless clicking or require some more thinking on the player's part.

### Levels

The game first starts out with simple levels teaching the basics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). As it progresses, higher level concepts are introduced until eventually getting to calculus. The approach to reaching the calculus based levels depends on the current level of math education they are at.
